###hello! my name is Jenny Lu and I'm a PhD student in the **Psychology** Department.

A few facts about myself:
1. I'm originally from Boston
2. I love to cook using different cooking techniques like sous vide
3. I like to do processes that involve fermentation such as making yogurt, bread, and beer
  
  I also run a workshop called ["Modalities of Lanugage"] (https://voices.uchicago.edu/modalitiesoflanguage/) where students and faculty come together to discuss interesting current research on sign language and gesture.
  *Come by and check it out!*
